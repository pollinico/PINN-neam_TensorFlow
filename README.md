# Physics informed neural network for approximating the deformed shape of a beam   

We consider a beam on two supports and with a distributed load.  

We approximate the numerical solution of the differential equation of the beam with a neural network:   

$$ \frac{\partial ^4 u}{\partial x ^4} EI - p = 0. $$

We use the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library for machine learning.
